# The Tech Academy - C# and .NET Framework Projects

This repository contains various C# projects completed during **The Tech Academy's** C# and .NET Framework training. 

### What we covered in the training:

### **Part 1 - Introduction to C# and .NET Framework:**
In Part 1, we focused on the fundamentals of C# programming, covering basic programming concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), and an introduction to the .NET Framework. We explored topics like memory management, type safety, garbage collection, and more. The projects emphasized building a solid foundation in C# and how to work within the .NET ecosystem.

- Key topics covered:
  - Basic Programming Terms
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Programming Paradigms (Procedural, Functional, Event-Driven)
  - Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Stack vs Heap)
  - C#, .NET Framework, and .NET Core Basics
  - Introduction to Exceptions and Exception Handling

### **Part 2 - Intermediate C# and Advanced .NET Concepts:**
Part 2 expanded on the basics and introduced more advanced C# concepts, including arrays, iteration, methods, and classes. We delved into debugging techniques, object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. The course concluded with hands-on projects using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and even Docker for containerization.

- Key topics covered:
  - Arrays and Iteration
  - Exception Handling
  - Classes, Methods, and Objects
  - Polymorphism, Interfaces, and Abstract Classes
  - MVC Fundamentals
  - ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework
  - File I/O, Lambda Expressions, and more!
